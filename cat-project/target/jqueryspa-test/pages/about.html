<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Arik (<a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/lastboy13">@lastboy13</a> <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/lastboy">Github(lastboy)</a>) the creator of <a target="_new" href="http://catjsteam.github.io/">CatJS framework</a> that is an open source automation framework. I used it for testing this application.</p>
<p> This project was created while I visited the <a target="_new" href="http://events.jquery.org/2014/chicago/">JQuery Chicago conference site</a> and I thought to myself, why not to come up with a nice skeleton project that can be used by others.</p>
<p> The initial project is based on TodoMVC AngularJS + RequireJS project, I just modified it according to my needs. Feel free to use it and if you have any questions or comment you know where to find me... </p>
